# Structured-Data-Cleaning-Process-for-Layoffs-Analysis
Welcome to the documentation site for the Layoffs Dataset Data Cleaning Project.
This guide explains how the data was transformed from raw format into a clean, structured, analysis-ready dataset using MySQL.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of company layoffs, improving data quality and consistency for future analytics and reporting.

Key problems addressed:
1.Duplicate records  
2.Inconsistent text formatting  
3.Mixed date formats  
4.Missing and blank values 
5.Unnecessary temporary columns  

The result is a curated database table suitable for dashboards, reports, and advanced analysis.
